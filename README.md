## Valkyrie Code

This is our first season using Java. Many teams' code was examined and lovingly
borrowed. Our largest thanks has to go out to the Cheesy Poofs (FRC 254), their
trajectory lib from 2014, is the heart of our auton, and we are still reading 
their adaptive pursuit code from 2015 to see if we can adapt that for use in this
year's teleop.

See our teams [website](http://lightningrobotics.com/) for more information about us.

**Full steam ahead!!!**
